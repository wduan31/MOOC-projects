Python-Game-Codes
=================
These python scripts are my mini-projects from "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" on Coursera.

The codes are stored on CodeSkulptor, which runs Python programs in your browser.

<p>The projects are as follows:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>"Guess the Number" game</li>
  <li>Stopwatch: The Game</li>
  <li>"Pong" game</li>
  <li>"Memory" game</li>
  <li>"Blackjack" game</li>
 <li>Spaceship from "RiceRocks" game</li>
  <li>Full "RiceRocks" game</li>
</ol>
By clicking the links in the files, you would access the codes. By running the code, you would enjoy the games then!
