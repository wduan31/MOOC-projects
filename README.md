Python-Game-Codes
=================
These python scripts are my mini-projects from "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" on Coursera.

The codes can be loaded into CodeSkulptor: http://www.codeskulptor.org/, and games can then be played through GUI.

A description of CodeSkulptor can be found here: http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python


<p>The projects are as follows:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>"Guess the Number" game</li>
  <li>Stopwatch: The Game</li>
  <li>"Pong" game</li>
  <li>"Memory" game</li>
  <li>"Blackjack" game</li>
 <li>Spaceship from "RiceRocks" game</li>
  <li>Full "RiceRocks" game</li>
</ol>
Hope you enjoy these mini-games.
